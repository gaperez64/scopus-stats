# QEST-FORMATS 2025 iCORE Application Data/Scripts
This repository contains scripts to fetch data (mostly from Scopus), as well
as some of the fetched data (June 2025).

For the scripts, you may need to install some packages (see `requirements.txt`)
or have access to the Scopus website and API (this holds for `h_index.py` in
particular).
